# Basketball Informational Website
My very first programming project I made in 2020 in my Computer Science course, with the help of my classmates Karson Chan and Manash Mathan.

## Purpose
This website was made to share and inform others of the history of basketball and the NBA, using a sleek and simple UI.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS

## Installation
Simply clone or download the ZIP file of the git repository and you may begin interacting with the website!

NOTE: To access all of the files, it may be necessary to open every file and image assets
